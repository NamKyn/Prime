Alas! Primes

<quote> <p>And ya, primes. Every quantity can be matched to a quality and distributed from a one to another. For instance, the merchandise inventory as quantity against its worth as quality. The quantity is expressed in nominal prime numbers while quality in ordinal. Say, the worth of 29 items is 10; the latter becomes quality, the former quantity, and it must be intended. After all, the 10th prime number is 29.</p> </quote>
